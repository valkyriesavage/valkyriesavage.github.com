After UIST, which was in Scotland, Bjoern decided to get his money's worth out of sending me across the Atlantic.  We set up a couple of visits to research labs while I was over there, which were conveniently accessible between St. Andrews University (founded, btw, before the invention of the apostrophe, and now 600 years old) and London's Heathrow Airport.
