Welcome to my blog!  The following is a draft of a post under submission to the <a href="http://fabworkshop.media.mit.edu">FAB at CHI</a> workshop happening this year at <a href="http://chi2013.acm.org/">CHI 2013</a> in Paris.  My advisor, <a href="http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern>Bj&ouml;rn Hartmann, is one of the directors of the workshop.
<br/>
<br/>
The plummeting cost of reasonable-quality 3D printers like <a href="http://typeamachines.com">Type A Machines</a> and <a href="http://makerbot.com">Makerbots</a>, combined with the presence of services like <a href="http://shapeways.com">Shapeways</a> that do custom object production on demand, promise an oncoming army of little plastic things.

Current online communities such as <a href="http://thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> serve as repositories of these things, which range from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/ArtInstituteChicago">3D scans of artwork at the Art Institute of Chicago</a> to <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30008">complex part-printed, part-routed, part-purchased copies of video game controllers</a>.  The composition of the site is heavily tilted towards the former: beautiful, captured rather than designed, and immobile jewelry or art pieces.  The next largest segment is copies of existing functional devices (like the joystick) for replacement or repair purposes.  However, only a small contingent of designers on the site (like <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/emmett">emmett</a>) create novel functional devices for sharing on the site.  Among these objects, very few have both electronic and mechanical functions such as would be necessary for the creation of tangible input devices.

Aside from 3D printers, other classes of digital fabrication hardware like <a href="http://www.rolanddga.com/products/cutters/stika/">vinyl cutters</a> and <a href="http://www.lpkfusa.com/protomat/e33.htm">circuit board milling machines</a> have reached consumer-friendly price points.  <a href="http://bid.berkeley.edu">Our group at Berkeley</a> is examining how to combine the abilities of these types of hardware to assist designers in prototyping tangible input devices, with an eye towards the ultimate goal of making prototyping this hardware more like prototyping software: <i>rapidly iterable, immediately functional, and easily learned</i>.  We want to use our work to educate and excite high school students in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM fields</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Tangible user interfaces (TUIs) are, according to <a href="tangible.media.mit.edu">Hiroshi Ishii</a>, about &#8220;giving physical form to digital information&#8221;.  Although touch screen-based interactions are increasingly popular as smartphone sales continue, there are still strong arguments for maintaining the tangibility of interfaces: these arguments range from speed and accuracy (a gamer using a gaming console) to visibility (ability of others to learn and interact with one&#8217;s data in a shared space) to safety and accessibility (including eyes-free interfaces for driving).  These themes and others are covered in many places, including <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2006/HowBodiesMatter-DIS2006.pdf">How Bodies Matter</a>, a paper by one of our group.
<br/>
<br/>
Our first project, <a href="http://bid.berkeley.edu/papers/uist/midas_fabricating_custom_capac/">Midas</a>, explored the use of vinyl cutters and circuitboard mills for the creation of custom capacitive touch sensors that can be designed and programmed without knowledge of electronics or programming skill.

</div>
Midas consists of a design tool for layout of the sensors, a vinyl cutter for fabrication of them, and a small microcontroller for communication with them.  The design tool takes the drag-and-drop paradigm currently prevalent in GUI development and expands it to hardware development: the designer does not trouble herself with routing or connective pieces, as these are instead taken care of behind the scenes by the tool.  The designer is free to concern herself with the <i>what</i> rather than the <i>how</i>.  Once a designer has completed her sensor layout, instructions are generated which lead her through a multi-step fabrication and assembly process.  In this process, she cuts her custom sensors from copper foil on a vinyl cutter, adheres them to her object, and connects them to color-coded wires.  She then uses the interface to describe on-screen interactions through a record and replay framework, or to program more complex interactions through WebSockets.
<br/>
<br/>Midas has been a success.  In user tests, we found the tool suitable for first-time users, and we found interest in it at venues like <a href="http://tltl.stanford.edu/fablearn2012">FabLearn</a>, a conference for fabrication technologies in education; and <a href="http://sketching-in-hardware.com/">Sketching in Hardware</a>, a weekend workshop for hackers, artists, and academics to think together about prototyping.  However, it has a fundamental limitation: it only assists designers with <i>touch-based</i> interactions.  In the larger TUI world, there are many more classes of input to be considered.

</div>
Continuing our explorations, we have begun a project called Sauron.  Our goal for this project is to enable designers to turn models fabricated on commodity 3D printers into interactive prototypes with a minimum of required assembly or instrumentation.  Given <a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/printed-optics/">Disney&#8217;s work</a> towards functional and fully assembled tangible input devices which can be fabricated on a 3D printer without supervision, pausing the print periodically to insert electronics or fiddling with wiring after the fact don&#8217;t seem to create reasonable interaction flows.  Sauron consists of an infrared camera with an array of IR LEDs.  This physical piece is inserted into already-printed devices.  The camera observes the backside of the end-user-facing input components (e.g. buttons, sliders, or direction pads), and via computer vision determines when a mechanism was actuated and how (e.g. it can give the position the slider was moved to along its track).
<br/>
<br/>
This allows designers to create functional objects as fast as they can print them: the only assembly required to make the parts work with Sauron is to insert the camera.  Our next steps in this project include developing a CAD tool plugin that will aid designers in building prototypes where the input components are visible to the single camera; the plugin will automatically place and move mirrors and internal geometry to make all components visible within the cone of vision.  This again frees the designer to think about the <i>what</i> rather than the <i>how</i> as prototypes come out of a 3D printer essentially <i>already functional</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
The world is interactive, but most things created using digital fabrication aren&#8217;t yet.  Through our work at Berkeley, and hopefully our interactions with the FAB at CHI workshop, we are hoping to explore the potential of digital fabrication tools for functional prototype design.
